# WordPress-Attack-Project

For our Final Engagement project, our team were tasked with defensive, offensive, and network analysis of a WordPress site. Utilizing an ELK SIEM and Kibana, we set up defensive alerts on our Target VM to monitor for any potential malicious activity. With our Kali VM, we attacked our Target VM to capture 4 flags hidden on the WordPress site and network. Finally, we captured and analyzed network traffic with Wireshark. 

Our presentation is focused on the Wireshark network analysis. Once a baseline of normal network traffic was established, our team was able to identify suspicious and malicious activity on the network including illegal torrent downloads and malware.
